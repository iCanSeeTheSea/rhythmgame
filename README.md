## Game Plan

- character moves across screen at a set speed
- screen split up into 'beats' represented by coloured boxes
- when a beat turns yellow, this is the beat you need to hit
- when the player enters the current beat and the space bar is pressed, the beat should turn green and the score increments  
- if the player misses the beat, the player changes direction but the score does not increment  > beat turns red
- more score given based on how much of player is in the beat
- if the player hits button before they are in the beat, beat turns red and no score given
- when the button is pressed the character changes direction
- when should press should sync with music

- background colour/ bars visualise music
